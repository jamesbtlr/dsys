    "feedback_error": "Vivid pink (#E0446E) used on the filled heart favorite icon. Assigned as feedback_error due to its role as the only non-green accent color and its red-family hue. Could alternatively be classified as an accent with no feedback assignment — but red-family colors in consumer apps typically serve the error/favorite semantic role."
