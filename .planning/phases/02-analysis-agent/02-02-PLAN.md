<objective>
Validate the Phase 2 deliverables end-to-end: confirm the schema extension is non-breaking, run the analyzer agent against a real screenshot, and verify the output is schema-conformant.

Purpose: The analyzer agent prompt is the product of careful engineering, but vision extraction quality can only be verified empirically. This plan runs the agent against a real image and validates the full pipeline from image input to schema-conformant JSON output.

Output: Validated schema, at least one real findings JSON in `.dsys/findings/`, and user confirmation of extraction quality.

  <name>Task 1: Validate schema extension and run analyzer agent</name>
  <files>

  </files>
  <action>
Perform three validation steps:

**Step A — Schema backward compatibility:**

Extract the two worked examples from `skills/dsys/references/analysis-findings-schema.md` (the SaaS dashboard and brand mood board examples). Write each to a temporary file and validate against the schema using ajv-cli:

```bash
npx ajv-cli validate \
  -s skills/dsys/schemas/analysis-findings.schema.json \
  -d /tmp/dsys-test-ui.json

npx ajv-cli validate \
  -s skills/dsys/schemas/analysis-findings.schema.json \
  -d /tmp/dsys-test-visual.json
```

Both must pass. If either fails, the schema extension broke backward compatibility — fix the schema before proceeding.

**Step B — Schema forward compatibility:**

Create a test document that includes the new `rationale` field. Take the SaaS dashboard example and add:
```json
"rationale": {
  "action_primary": "Purple-blue used on all interactive buttons and selected tab indicators",
  "surface_default": "Near-white background covering the main content area"
}
```

Validate this extended document against the schema. It must pass.

Also create a test document with `partial_failure: true` and `failed_categories: ["shadows"]` — validate it passes.

**Step C — Run the analyzer agent against a real screenshot:**

Find or create a screenshot to test with. Options in order of preference:
1. Check if any image files exist in the project: `find . -name "*.png" -o -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.webp" | head -5`
2. If none exist, take a screenshot of a well-known website. Use the Read tool to read any available screenshot.
3. As a last resort, use one of the Phase 1 example images if referenced anywhere.

If an image is available, invoke the analyzer agent by following its instructions manually:
1. Read the image using the Read tool
2. Follow Steps 1-8 of the analyzer agent prompt exactly
3. Write the output to `.dsys/findings/test-validation.json`
4. Validate the output: `npx ajv-cli validate -s skills/dsys/schemas/analysis-findings.schema.json -d .dsys/findings/test-validation.json`

If NO image is available in the project, create `.dsys/findings/` directory and skip to the checkpoint — the user will provide a screenshot for testing.

**Step D — Error handling validation:**

Test the two error paths documented in the agent:
1. Attempt to read a file with unsupported extension (e.g., `test.bmp`) — verify the error message format matches "Error: Unsupported format: .bmp (use PNG, JPG, or WebP)"
2. Attempt to read a nonexistent file path — verify the error message format matches "Error: File not found or unreadable: {path}"

These are manual verification of the prompt instructions, not automated tests. Confirm the error message templates are present and correctly formatted in the agent prompt.

If schema validation (Steps A or B) fails, fix the schema in `analysis-findings.schema.json` before proceeding. Document what was fixed.
  </action>
  <verify>
All ajv-cli validations pass:
- Phase 1 SaaS dashboard example: valid
- Phase 1 brand mood board example: valid
- New example with rationale field: valid
- New example with partial_failure + failed_categories: valid

If a real screenshot was available:
- `.dsys/findings/test-validation.json` exists and passes ajv validation
- The JSON contains plausible extracted values (not placeholder text)

Error message templates confirmed present in analyzer.md.
  </verify>
  <done>
Schema extension is confirmed non-breaking (Phase 1 examples still validate). New optional fields (rationale, partial_failure, failed_categories) are accepted by the schema. If a screenshot was available, the analyzer produced schema-conformant output. Error handling templates are correctly specified.
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: User review of analyzer agent and extraction quality</name>
  <action>
Present the analyzer agent and schema extension for user review. If the user provides a screenshot, run the analyzer agent against it and show the results.
  </action>
  <what-built>
Complete analysis agent: schema extension with rationale/partial_failure fields, analyzer agent prompt with embedded rubric and templates, and schema validation confirming backward compatibility.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Review the analyzer agent prompt at `skills/dsys/agents/analyzer.md`:
   - Does it read clearly as a step-by-step guide for Claude?
   - Are the extraction rubric and fill-in templates embedded correctly?
   - Do the locked decisions (exact color preservation, decorative exclusion, error format) appear?

2. If you have a screenshot to test with:
   - Provide a screenshot path and ask Claude to analyze it using the analyzer agent
   - Review the findings JSON: are the extracted colors plausible? Typography identified? Spacing snapped to 4px grid?
   - Check the rationale strings: do they explain the reasoning for semantic assignments?

3. Review the schema changes at `skills/dsys/schemas/analysis-findings.schema.json`:
   - The `rationale`, `partial_failure`, and `failed_categories` fields should be present but NOT in the `required` array

4. If extraction quality is poor, note specific issues — they may require prompt adjustments in a gap closure plan.

<verification>
1. All four ajv-cli validation tests pass (two backward-compat, two forward-compat)
2. If a screenshot was tested: findings JSON exists in `.dsys/findings/` and passes validation
3. User has reviewed the analyzer agent prompt and confirmed it meets expectations
4. Error handling format is verified in the agent prompt
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Schema extension is proven non-breaking via ajv-cli validation of Phase 1 examples
- New rationale and partial_failure fields are accepted by the schema
- User has reviewed and approved the analyzer agent prompt
- If a screenshot was tested: output is schema-conformant and extraction quality is acceptable
</success_criteria>
